This is my practice related to AI & Computer Graphics as my demos related to my domain of interests. 

## Usage

Requirements:
- Python >= 3.9

Follow these steps in following order:

1) git clone https://github.com/wh1t3lord/ai.git
2) pip install requirements.txt
3) now you can choose any demo that you want to see
